            Lipstick has been a staple in beauty routines for centuries. It's
            versatile, comes in a multitude of shades, and can be used to
            express your mood and style. No matter the occasion, having a
            favorite lipstick in your bag is a must.

              To keep your lipstick in perfect condition, store it in a cool,
              dry place. Always cap your lipstick after use to prevent it from
              drying out. For a longer-lasting color, use a lip liner and apply
              multiple layers, blotting in between.
